# Hello Node!

Building on [another socket drawing app](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/cci-node-socket-draw-03?path=README.md%3A1%3A0),
this example (temporarily) stores past gestures/strokes to the server so that new clients can see past drawings.
See `client.js` for updates to the p5.js code, which includes receiving a new kind of message from the server that will enable drawing past strokes.
See `server.js` for additional implementation to store strokes in an array. Note that this storage is not very permanent‚Äîit will only stick around as long as the server is not restarted.
For more permanent storage, you will need a database (example coming in-class on Thursday).

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript.
This project uses the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework.
Please do not upgrade to Express version 5, which is incompatible with the version of node.js that Glitch uses.

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript.
If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `public/style.css`: The styling rules for the pages in your site.

‚Üê `public/client.js`: The JavaScript for the site's front-end. This connects to a socket to talk to the server and contains our p5.js code.

‚Üê `public/index.html`: This is the main index for the site. In other Glitch examples, you may see HTML templates with libraries like Handlebars instead of an index.html

‚Üê `server.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. In this example, we set up some simple socket communication in addition to serving HTML, CSS, and JS files.

‚Üê `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

Note: this is a template developed by Glitch and uses Fastify instead of Express.
Both libraries are similar in function, but have different syntax.
